# Python Tutorial (13-15 July)
In this tutorial you will get a brief introduction to Python programming. Even without prior knowledge of any programming language you should be able to follow along. Since the group is very small I will make this tutorial as interactive as possible. Most of the time you will be coding yourself to have as much hands-on experience as possible. As I do not know how fast/slow we will be able to move through the content I encourage you to think of a programming problem (from your research) yourself, which we will discuss and hopefully implement as well.

## Preparation
* Please visit [this webiste](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Welcome) and go through the examples in “Learn the Basics”. You can run the code online and do not need to install anything. We will repeat some of the exercises during the tutorial. 

## Requirements
* A project or an idea what you would like to program that may help you with your research
* Anaconda for Python 3.6 (download the right version for your system from  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)). We will install this together.

## Suggested topics 
(let me know if you want to cover additional topics)
1. Setup of Anaconda Environment
   1. Creating a development environment 
   2. Package management
   3. conda-forge
   4. Text Editor or IDE?
   5. Track your code changes with ```git```
2.	How to read a documentation
3.	The ```>>>``` prompt and basic built-in functions (```print()```, ```format()```, ```type()```, and ```help()```)
4. Command line programs
   1.	Writing, formatting and organizing a ```*.py``` file
   2.	If statement
   3.	For and While loop
   4.	Try statement
   5.	Functions
   6.	Parsing arguments using ```argparse```
   7.	Traceback and error handling.
   8.	“Hello Frank, it’s 12:39 on Tuesday March 15th, 2018”
5.	Image processing (using ```scikit-image```)
6.	Plotting graphs with ```matplotlib```
7.	Batch download data with ```wget```
8.	Student projects
9.	(Database interaction)

## Goals
Be able to set up your python programming environment; use command line arguments to read, modify and write files (text and images); plot graphs and figures; batch download data from the internet; and (if time permits) interact with a database.
